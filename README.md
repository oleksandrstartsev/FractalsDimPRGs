<div> About. 
<blockquote>
<p>There are few folders with the latest versions of working programs for calculation of fractal dimensions of arrays.
I used Clarke's method as a basic method, then added sliding window, different variations of geometric- and arithmetic-step methods, along with the devisor-step method. All .pas files and compiled .exe files include the read/write subroutines for the thermographic data files .IS2. But you can simply read data from .dat or .txt files, or easily import .jpeg and transfrom/convert it into array.
